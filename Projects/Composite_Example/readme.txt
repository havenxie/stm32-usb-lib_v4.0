Example description
===================
This Demo provides a description of how to use the USB-FS-Device on the STM32F10xxx, 
STM32F37xxx, STM32F30xxx and STM32L15xxx devices.
The examples provide a composite device
A composite device is one that has multiple interfaces controlled independently of each other.
Using composite device, multiple functions are combined into a single device.
In this Example the independent interfaces are : Mass Storage (MSC) and Custom HID

LED1,LED2 and LED3 are reserved for Custom HID demo
LED4 reserved for MSC, it is ON when MicroSD is Ready for write and read operations.

When even one of the interface class of the device is changed, it should be handled
differently by Windows. However, it doesn't recognize the modification. To avoid conflict on
Windows, we suggest to assign another VID/PID to the device (idProduct = 0x5750) or
delete device instance from device manager.

More details about this Demo implementation is given in the User manual 
"UM0424 STM32F10xxx USB development kit", available for download from the ST
microcontrollers website: www.st.com/stm32

Hardware environment
====================
This example runs these STMicroelectronics evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware: 

- STM3210B-EVAL
- STM3210E-EVAL
- STM32L152-EVAL
- STM32F373C_EVAL
- STM32F303C_EVAL
- STM32L152D-EVAL

To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
     - Jumper JP1 (USB disconnect) should be connected in position 2-3.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
     - Jumper JP14 (USB disconnect) should be connected in position 2-3. 

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up 
     - Jumpers JP18 and JP19 should be connected. 
     - Jumper JP17 should be connected in position 5-6 (PB12 connector)
     - Note that JoySitck Right and Left buttons are used for this Demo.
	 
  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up 
	 - LCD Glass should be mounted On IO position for Potentiometer usage.
	 - JP13 should be connected to ADC input. 

  - STM32F373C_EVAL  Set-up 
      - None. 

  - STM32F303C_EVAL  Set-up 
      - None.
