Example description
===================
The USB-FS-Device Audio Speaker demo gives examples of how to use the STM32F10xxx 
and STM32L15xxx USB-FS-Device peripheral to communicate with the PC host in the 
isochronous transfer mode.
It provides a demonstration of the correct method for configuring an isochronous
endpoint, receiving or transmitting data from/to the host.

More details about this Demo implementation is given in the User manual 
"UM0424 STM32F10xxx USB development kit", available for download from the ST
microcontrollers website: www.st.com/stm32

Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL, STM3210E-EVAL and 
STM32L152-EVAL evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.
    
  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
     - Jumper JP1 (USB disconnect) should be connected in position 2-3.
     - Jumper JP6 should be not connected.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
     - Jumper JP14 (USB disconnect) should be connected in position 2-3.
     - Jumper JP18 (MCKI) should be connected in position 2-3.
  
  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up 
     - Jumper JP16 (Audio Out) should be not connected.
